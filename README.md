>To ensure the integrity of the platform, Chirp utilizes the [Twinword Emotion Analysis API](https://www.twinword.com/api/emotion-analysis.php) to filter out happy posts and encourages users to delve deeper into their frustrations.

By excluding happy posts, Chirp can create a space that focuses on the raw and often unspoken aspects of human experiences. This approach encourages users to be introspective, acknowledge their frustrations, and find solace in shared struggles.
